                    <p>The sort of adventure Scouting offers is the chance to experience <span class="bold">something different</span> 
                    and the opportunity to <span class="bold">challenge yourself</span>. When a Cub Scout has just got over her fear of heights by completing her first abseil - that’s adventure.
                    In Scouting, we provide over <span class="bold">200 activities</span> from abseiling to zorbing (that’s falling out of the sky in a foam ball in 
                    case you were wondering). If we don’t have an instructor who can help we can normally find someone who can. 
                    But Scouting isn’t just about activities for their own sake.
                    We encourage our young people to <span class="bold">feel the buzz</span> of the challenge and then reflect on what that means. </br></br>
                    <span class="highlight_text">Did they have fun?</br></br> Do they feel more confident?</br></br> Would they do it again?</span></p>
